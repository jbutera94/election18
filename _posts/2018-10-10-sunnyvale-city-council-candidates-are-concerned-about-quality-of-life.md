Sunnyvale City Council candidates are concerned that the city’s quality of life is being challenged by many social and environmental issues.

On Oct. 4, Sunnyvale City Council candidates Glenn Hendricks, Gustav Larsson, Josh Grossman and Henry Alexander III attended a press conference held by Summit Denali student journalists.

Sunnyvale is about the size of Mountain View and Cupertino combined, according to the [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/The-scramble-for-Sunnyvale-Tech-companies-in-12908684.php). According to the [Sunnyvale website](https://sunnyvale.ca.gov/community/parks/maps.htm) and the [Cupertino website](http://gis.cupertino.org/parkfinder/), Sunnyvale has 22 parks, while Cupertino has over 30 parks.

“The most important thing is the quality of life. The quality of life has decreased ever since the developments have started to increase. We need more parks to improve the quality of life,” Mr. Alexander said.

In December 2016, the Sunnyvale City Council voted in favor of the Silicon Valley Clean Energy Act. According to the [Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/25/sunnyvale-municipal-electricity-to-go-100-percent-green-energy/),“The move means 100 percent of the city’s energy will come from renewable, carbon-free energy sources come April.”

Clean energy has been a focus for the City Council when discussing the quality of life. “We brought clean energy to Sunnyvale; we want other cities in Santa Clara County to participate in that,” Mr. Hendricks said.

Other candidates were concerned that development in Sunnyvale has affected quality of life for residents.

“I got involved in politics because I remember people getting kicked out of a mobile home park for a six dwelling unit to be put in its place,” Mr. Grossman said. “We need to make sure that companies like Apple and Google pay their share in our city. Currently Apple and Google together pay $24,000 to the city of Sunnyvale for being here. We want to make sure that large companies pay their share.”
