According to State Assemblymember Marc Berman, the state of California will continue to act independently from the federal government regarding issues such as climate change and immigration.

Rep. Berman said the federal government’s backtracking policies are “not making it easy for us … We think of ourselves as a shadow government … in opposition to federal policies.” Rep. Berman describes his party’s positions as opposition to many of the policies taken by the new administration, especially on issues of climate change and immigration.

His views echo those of the [DNC](https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#remove-barriers): “These principles stand in sharp contrast to the Republicans, who have nominated as the standard-bearer for their party and their candidate for President a man who seeks to appeal to Americans’ basest differences, rather than our better natures.”

Rep. Berman said, when addressing his party’s policy on climate change in opposition to federal stance: “[We want to] establish our goal …100 percent renewable energy by 2025.” Here, Rep. Berman is reflective of the general state policy in California regarding climate change.

As follows, the [Democratic Party](https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#environment) is seen to hold some of those same views: “We will reduce methane emissions from all oil and gas production and transportation by at least 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 through common-sense standards for both new and existing sources and by repairing and replacing thousands of miles of leaky pipes. This will both protect our climate and create thousands of good-paying jobs.”  

When defending his party’s policy on climate regulation measures, Rep. Berman said the policy “creates good jobs and also improves the environment.” He also stated that his government acted contrary to pressure from other states who felt such efforts were not a proper use of the California budget.
