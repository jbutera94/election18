With the Belmont City Council election coming up, Warren Lieberman has been busy working on his campaign for city council. Lieberman has served as a Belmont city councilman / mayor for 12 years. With four candidates running, and only three spots available, Mr. Lieberman has his work cut out for him.

According to Mr. Lieberman, the way Belmont runs their elections is quite different. Instead of voting for a mayor, Belmont citizens vote candidates onto a city council, which is composed of five people who then vote on who will be mayor for the following year. A council member will serve a term of four years, although new ones swap in every two years. Every two years there is an election; this year three members will be appointed, joining the other two members who started two years ago. In two years from now, two more members will be elected to join the three elected this year.

This year, Mr. Lieberman is running for his fourth term on city council. Mr. Lieberman said, “I have several priorities. One is to do what I can to maintain and improve the quality of life for those folks who live in and work in Belmont and that can mean anything from improvement in our sports fields, maintaining our open space, improving traffic and working to improve and reduce congestion.”

One of Mr. Lieberman’s big goals is to bring back citizen lunches, where he would have lunch with a Belmont resident to discuss any city-related topic. He said, “I started a ‘Lunches with the Mayor’ program where every month we got six to eight people from the public who signed up to have lunch with me and our city manager and the city treasurer. And people began to learn about how their city government worked in a very relaxed environment.”

As for the other candidates, Mr. Lieberman has a good relationship with them and is looking forward to working with them to better improve our city.
