State Assemblymember Marc Berman believes that the current California tax system is creating economic inequality which shows through the education system.

On Oct. 5, Rep. Berman was interviewed by Summit Denali students during a press conference. “We rely too heavily on income tax and not on property tax,” he said.

“Our tax system is so volatile because we rely too heavily on income tax and not enough on things like sales tax or property tax,” Rep. Berman said. “When you have a strong economy you get a lot of income tax, and when you have a poor economy you get very little income tax and capital gains tax.”

Rep. Berman saw the effects of the California tax system, the largest being economic inequality, on different communities during his childhood. “I got interested in politics because when I played competitive soccer; I got to look at the kids around me and see how they were less fortunate than me,” he said. “It made me upset that I was able to receive a good education but other kids around me didn’t, even though it was just bad luck that got them where they were.”

The inequality in Rep. Berman’s childhood community, he argued, is the result of the California tax system. “When you get a downturn in the economy, the state gets way less money, and our school funding is kind of tied as a percentage of a state funding,” he explained.  

According to the [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/fr/eb/), the education budget makes up 40 percent of the state budget. “The state budget directs how education funds are to be spent,” the department’s website explains.

Rep. Berman believes that one way to solve this issue is to store money in reserves. “The responsible thing is to put money in reserves because we know that there is going to be an economic downturn.”
