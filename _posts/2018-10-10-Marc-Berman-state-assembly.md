State Assemblymember Marc Berman is focused on helping marginalized communities.

“We need to make sure that everybody understands that our diversity is the biggest strength that California has, and the different backgrounds and the different experiences that we bring to solving issues make our solutions that much stronger,” Rep. Berman said while discussing what can be done to end discrimination.

On Oct. 5, State Assemblymember Marc Berman visited Summit Denali for a press conference. He discussed helping sexual assault survivors, youth who struggle with mental health issues, members of the LGBTQ+ community and the homeless, among other important issues.

When asked to share some of the projects he has worked on in the past, Rep. Berman discussed the work he has done for sexual assault survivors, including creating the [Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights](https://a24.asmdc.org/press-releases/20171012-governor-brown-signs-sexual-assault-survivors-bill-rights), which “tries to reduce the obstacles to reporting an attack and also tries to make the process a lot better for the survivors as they go through the justice system.”

He also added that this year he “extended the statute of limitations for survivors of sexual assault to be able to bring a lawsuit in civil court and receive monetary damages for the impacts of the attack” from two years to 10.

Sharing his reasoning for the change, Rep. Berman added, “The impact of sexual assault … on the survivor is really terrible, and it can take a long time for somebody to … recover from the impacts of the act and then feel comfortable speaking about it and reporting on it – so as we’ve learned more and more about this issue, it’s important that our justice system … provide for an environment where people can go through that process of recovering and then still be able to get the money damages that they should get.”

Rep. Berman also talked about the work he did for youth mental health and suicide prevention, with the help of the state budget: “In this year’s budget, I got [$1.7 million](https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2018/06/27/state-to-fund-suicide-prevention-training-for-schools) for the state to identify the best online youth mental health and suicide prevention training that’s available and then buy enough subscriptions to make it available to every middle school and high school in the state for free.”

When asked about what he could do to help the homeless, he also discussed working on mental health, among other factors that could be explored in order to help fix homelessness: “We need to get them into stable housing first and get a stable roof over their head, but … we can’t then just give them the keys and walk away; we need to give them the wrap-around services, the mental health services, the job training, the food, so that they can stay housed and they can hopefully, eventually, become productive members of society.”

Additionally, when asked about whether he has done work that benefits the LGBTQ+ community, Rep. Berman discussed working with the [Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) for training for suicide prevention for students. He also added that “40 percent of Bay Area homeless youth or California homeless youth are LGBT, and we know that a lot of LGBTQ+ youth struggle the most with mental health issues, as they’re, you know, kind of, getting comfortable with who they are and being who they are, and so we need to provide more resources and be even more aware of that, so that they feel more welcome in the community as anybody else does.”

When asked about marginalized communities and what could be done to end discrimination, Rep. Berman stated that he and his colleagues will keep passing policies that protect immigrant communities and “keep on emphasizing the fact that this is a good thing and not a bad thing and also keep on passing laws that make it illegal to discriminate.”

When asked about the immigration policies currently being passed, Rep. Berman stated that he thinks “we’re passing good ones in California, and they’re passing bad ones in Washington, D.C.” Elaborating further, he shared his family’s history of immigration, and ended with “immigrants come to America because they want a better life and a safer life than where they are coming from, and that’s something we should support; that’s something we need to embrace; that’s something that makes America a stronger place.”

Rep. Berman shared a lot of ideas about making laws that support marginalized people. While discussing empathy, he said, “It’s important to respect each other and the differences that we have.”
