Sunnyvale City Council candidates value the quality of life in the city. As incumbent Glenn Hendricks puts it, “We need to have long-term financial stability in order to afford our sewage systems and parks.”

On Oct. 4, four local Sunnyvale City Council candidates visited Summit Denali to answer questions about their views and plans as city council members.

One important issue that was discussed by all candidates was quality of life for the citizens of Sunnyvale.

Challenger Henry Alexander III mainly focused on improving the quality of life for Sunnyvale through adding more open spaces and improving traffic.

Mr. Hendricks agreed that quality of life is an important problem to look at. However, he thinks that the city of Sunnyvale needs to focus on their long-term financial stability first. He backed up his claim by pointing out that you need money to fund these quality of life improvements.

On the subject of finances, challenger Josh Grossman led the discussion by pointing out that the board is rapidly approving new businesses to help the financial situation and that is causing people in mobile homes to leave Sunnyvale due to high rents and having their lots being replaced with luxury condos.

Incumbent Gustav Larsson brought up his ideas to help solve the issues of traffic, finances, quality of life and the housing crisis. His idea was to add more housing in proximity to VTA transport and workplaces. He pointed out how this would work because the housing would make more money for the city and putting people closer to workplaces and transportation would mean that less traffic would be on the road. Also, less traffic means a higher quality of life, and, of course, adding housing would help the housing crisis.

While on the subject of quality of life, they all agreed that community safety is important. When asked about gun control, the incumbent, Mr. Hendricks, and the challenger, Mr.  Grossman, for Seat #2 responded with a similar answer regarding mental health checkups and common sense gun control. However, Mr. Alexander responded differently to the question of how to help with this issue of gun control. “It’s an info overload,” he stated. Mr. Alexander claimed that electronic information is overloading the minds of the students, putting more stress on their mental health.

When the candidates were asked, “How do you think you can solve school shootings?” they responded with answers that mostly corresponded with each other. Most of the candidates said we need more gun control laws, though each had their own differences. Mr. Hendricks talked about how you can’t really fix school shootings, although to stop most of them you need stricter gun control laws and mental health checks.

Mr. Grossman said in response to the school shootings question that you need common sense, and you need to have gun control laws and “mental health checkups at a national level.” Mr. Alexander said that schools need to take a step back and focus on helping students deal with stress and that “gun laws need to be explored.”

In response to the question about school shootings, Mr. Larsson said he wanted to make the city “ready for these issues” and steered away from giving a direct answer. However, when asked about getting the city down to zero emissions, he answered, “We have already started that,” and talked about how Sunnyvale is ahead of other cities but it needs to put its completely clean energy to better use and residents need more efficient electronics.

All the candidates had similar stories of getting into politics through local issues. Mr. Grossman was School Board president; after leaving that office, he missed local politics and decided to run for a different position. Mr. Larsson got into politics by making a petition to change something in the city, and he feels he made a difference. Mr. Alexander tried to save a park in his neighbor by mobilizing 10,000 residents, yet still lost. Finally, Mr. Hendricks got into politics by going to a local meeting, only to get ignored. All of the city council candidates had similar ways of getting into politics, through local issues, Despite their similarities, they have different takes on the same issues.
