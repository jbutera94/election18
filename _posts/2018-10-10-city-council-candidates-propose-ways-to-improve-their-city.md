Sunnyvale City Council candidates are concerned about housing problems in the community.

On Oct. 4, four Sunnyvale City Council candidates came to Summit Denali to talk about how they can improve their city. In Seat 1, the incumbent Gustav Larsson is running against challenger Henry Alexander III. In Seat 2, the incumbent Glenn Hendricks is running against challenger Josh Grossman.

Candidates discussed what got them into politics in the first place. They all had the same concept of solving the problems in their communities.

“I had heard from families who can afford to buy a house and still don’t get picked because of the competition,” Mr. Larsson said.

According to [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/sunnyvale-ca/home-values/), the average rate for home value in Sunnyvale is $1,914,600; that rate has gone up by 21.8 percent over the past year and will likely go up by 10 percent next year.  

Part of the issue, Mr. Larsson said, is how hard it is for community members to get to work. “We should use housing near jobs or near close transportation to jobs,” he said.

Another issue, for Mr. Grossman, is that available space is really shrinking in the community. “We should stop building because it will get too crowded in Sunnyvale,” he said.  

According to [SFCurved.com](http://sf.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15425050/sunnyvale-housing-growth-apple-goldman), Sunnyvale City Councilmember Michael Goldman said, “Well, there’s no unanimity. Basically what I hear is most people saying, ‘Hey, we’re full, I can’t get out of my driveway, there are too many businesses cramming people into offices.’”

All four of these City Council candidates want to see Sunnyvale prosper and become healthy; they will work to help the communities around them. They will aim to make Sunnyvale a better place to live and work.
