The Sunnyvale City Council candidates have strong feelings about school safety and gun violence. They feel the need to address mental health and how to keep students safe.

“Sunnyvale has been named the safest city in the U.S. the third year in a row, so we’re really proud of that, but safest city does not mean crime-free, and that’s something that we have to stay on top of … because we don’t want to say, ‘Oh, it’s never gonna happen here.’ Things can happen here, and we need to be ready for that,” said Gustav Larsson, the Seat 1 incumbent, when asked about school shootings and what the City Council was doing to prevent them.

On Oct. 4, four City Council candidates, Gustav Larsson, Henry Alexander III, Glenn Hendricks, and Josh Grossman, visited Summit Denali for a press conference. They discussed many important issues, including what could be done by the council to lessen the possibility of school shootings.

Glenn Hendricks, the Seat 2 incumbent and Mayor of Sunnyvale, talked about meeting the students on the steps of City Hall after one of the shootings earlier this year: “I told them, ‘Hey, thank you for coming out; you’re doing the right thing by raising your voice and showing you’re concerned about what this is.’ We talked about the things that we’re planning to do in the city.”

Some of the candidates also expressed concern about the mental health of students and how that might be tied to the increasing number of school shootings that have been seen in the United States in recent years.

Mr. Hendricks talked about working with current supervisors of the city to “try and get more money for mental health for people,” as “mental health is not necessarily something that is a budgeted item in the city.”

Mr. Larsson talked about collaboration within different levels of government and agencies, stating that “the school districts have one set of responsibilities, but mental health, for example, is really at the county level. Police and fire officers are at the city level. We all have to work together, communicate together.”

Henry Alexander III, the Seat 1 challenger, said he felt like the students were under too much stress, proposing that “the schools should do a better job at educating the children about … scaling back some. Because everything is so … information overload, and for me it’s overwhelming, and my brain is, I’d like to say it’s developed … when you’re growing up that’s just probably just a little bit too much.”

The candidates also discussed gun control and how that might be related to preventing school shootings and improving school safety.

Josh Grossman, the Seat 2 challenger, said that he sympathized with the students who had to deal with school shootings and the aftermath of them, arguing that the way we need to fix school shootings is “common sense gun control at the national level. We need to have mental health checks, and we need to work forward to do that.” Mr. Grossman encouraged the students of Summit Denali to get more involved and to vote when they are old enough in order to solve the issue America has with gun control.

Mr. Hendricks spoke about encouraging more states to follow in California’s footsteps, seeing as California has some of the strictest gun laws. He also talked about some of the things being done by the city of Sunnyvale to prevent gun violence, including the gun buyback program that was conducted on the last weekend of September 2018. Mr. Hendricks explained, “567 guns were turned in. And these are guns that people didn’t want anymore, they’re not in their house; they no longer have the opportunity to be stolen and get into criminal’s hands.”

Mr. Alexander backed up his fellow candidates, agreeing that “gun laws need to be explored” from a national level.

The candidates agreed that school shootings are a major problem and that there are many things that can be done in order to prevent more from happening, including stricter gun laws and investing more resources in the mental health of students.
