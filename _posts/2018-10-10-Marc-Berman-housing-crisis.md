Assemblymember Marc Berman believes that the housing crisis in California acts as the basis for many other unsolved issues.

Rep. Berman said that California’s various issues are “all important.” However, the lack of affordable and available housing acts as the “foundation for a lot of the other problems.” Homelessness and a lack of well-funded education systems are just a few of those issues.

Marc Berman, the 24 District Assembly representative of California, visited Summit Denali on Oct. 5 to take part in a press conference hosted by Summit News student journalists.   

According to [The San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/Bay-Areas-most-Competitive-real-estate-markets-13106103.php), the real estate markets in Fremont, San Jose, Oakland, and San Francisco are among the most competitive cities for homebuyers in the United States. The article’s source, [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/blog/2018/07/seattle-san-jose-and-fremont-calif-are-the-most-competitive-u-s-housing-markets.html), explains that these prices are likely due to the abundance of technology-based companies in the area and their tendencies to bring employees into these cities.  

“The cost of living in this area is incredibly high. That puts a lot of pressure on us and it means that a lot of people have to leave and life further and further away,” Rep. Berman said. “So now our housing crisis has affected transportation, it’s affected the environment, and education.”

The housing issue has also led to a higher rate of homelessness. According to [The California State Senate](https://stran.senate.ca.gov/sites/stran.senate.ca.gov/files/2017_homelessness_in_california_2017.docx), California’s 2017 homeless population accounted for 25 percent of the nation’s homeless population. This number rose from 22 percent in 2016.

Rep. Berman believes that in order to combat this issue, California must provide the homeless population with the resources they’ll need to get back on their feet. “We need to give [homeless citizens] the wraparound services: the mental health services, the job training, the food, so that they can stay housed and they can hopefully eventually become productive members of society,” Rep. Berman said. “But it really all starts with housing.”

Many issues in California require long-term solutions, including the housing crisis and a lack of funding for education. Rep. Berman believes that tax reform will fix these economic challenges. Rep. Berman said, “The real answer to stabilizing school funding in California is comprehensive tax reform because school funding is so unstable because our tax system is so volatile.”

According to an editorial from the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/opinion/tn-gnp-me-commentary-roberson-20180201-story.html), “California has the sixth largest economy in the world yet ranks 45th nationally in the percentage of taxable income spent on education.” However, recent steps were taken by California Governor Jerry Brown that aim to increase these funds.     

“All of those are important issues,” Rep. Berman said. “But I think housing and the cost of housing is the first domino that creates all of the other issues.”
