On Nov. 6, Belmont will have its City Council election. Candidate Julia Mates answered questions about the upcoming election and her passion for Belmont.

Mrs. Mates answered a series of questions related to the Belmont City Council Election in the following interview. Mrs. Mates explained that she chose to run for City Council because she started off as a planning commissioner, and she applied to the position of City Council to be able to see some of the plans on the Planning Commission be updated and eventually seen through. “I just kinda wanted to make sure we saw those through, and I would be able to do that with City Council.”

Mrs. Mates talked about her priorities if she were to get elected, which included things that were already in place at Belmont such as the 9/11 emergency response, making sure that schools are safe and keeping the spread of wildfires under control.

She also talked about the housing crisis in Belmont and her plan to provide housing for their residents. She believes that the housing problem could be too big for Belmont to solve on its own, but that the City Council can keep things stable and lookout for new housing projects.

“It’s a huge problem, so I don’t think Belmont can take care of that housing issue on it’s own,” she said. “But making sure that, you know, we continue to build housing units and give an eye toward where we can place housing.”

She continued to talk about her passion for Belmont City Council on her [website](https://www.juliamates.com/). On the site, Mrs. Mates stated that she is optimistic for the future of Belmont and that she hopes to see it’s community grow.

“I am honored to be serving you on the Belmont City Council to champion and maintain the quality of life services you expect and deserve.”
