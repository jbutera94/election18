California State Assemblymember Marc Berman believes that the housing crisis in California is a major problem.

On Oct. 5, Rep. Marc Berman came to visit Summit Denali to answer questions at a student-led press conference led by the journalists of Summit News.

Rep. Berman spoke about the high cost of housing in the state. “This problem is the foundation for many of the other problems we are facing. And living in this area is very, very expensive. So housing is one of the major problems California is facing.”

Rep. Berman explained that “the cost of living in this area is very high, which makes people move farther and farther away.”

People moving away causes a lot of pollution because they are coming to work from far away which causes another problem. “They drive to work here because most have jobs that are here, but we don’t have houses that are in their wanted budget, which then causes another problem, which is pollution,” he added.

The housing crisis also leads to another problem, which is that more people become homeless due to the lack of money for housing, he argued.

“We need housing to fix the homelessness. If we have more affordable housing, then that can also fix the homelessness problem.”
