This year, Summit Public Schools: Shasta has over 30 clubs organized by students. Most students are involved in at least one of these clubs, which meet after school, during lunch or off campus.

Clubs at Summit Shasta are run by student leaders, who can create a club if enough students are interested, with the support of a teacher. In the beginning of September, a large club fair is set up at lunch, with club leaders trying to entice students to sign up for all kinds of groups.

Throughout the year, clubs meet, sometimes holding fundraisers to earn money for their activities. In these clubs, all grades interact and students make new connections through a common interest.

Clubs have been at Shasta from the very beginning because students have had extracurricular hobbies and activities that they wanted to share with their peers. Every year, clubs change based on the interest of the students and the number of club leaders who step up to organize a group.

Most students believe that clubs are enjoyable, but do clubs change Summit Shasta? Do they influence the community here?

#### For an in-depth look at one student-led club, see below:

The Young Dreamer Network is an example of a club that brings students together and helps to build the community locally, as well as abroad.

Shasta senior Sabrina Robinson is the co-leader of the Young Dreamer Network at Summit Shasta. The Young Dreamer Network is an organization that sends students on service trips across the globe over the summer. Robinson is also involved in three other clubs: Service Club, Animal Awareness Club and Car Club.

Robinson and Shasta senior Kaitlyn Becker started the club last year after they went on a service trip to Guatemala the summer after sophomore year.

“Kaitlyn and I signed ourselves up for a trip to Guatemala sophomore year and when we came back, we just knew that we wanted others to experience different cultures like we were able to,” Robinson said.  

Now, in its second year as a club at Summit Shasta, the Young Dreamer Network has over 40 students who attend the weekly meetings. Some of these students will volunteer on weekends and go on service trips over the summer.

As a club leader, and a member of many other clubs, Robinson has a strong opinion about how clubs impact the school community. She believes that clubs make a very positive change in the school.

“They really provide an outlet for students to develop their social skills, making a really positive impact on our community as a whole,” she said. “Being a part of so many clubs at Shasta actually really helped me transition into its unique community as a freshman.”

Many staff members and students also believe that clubs build connections between grade levels. Robinson said that she felt more connected to students because of the clubs.

“All the clubs that I’ve participated in over the years have helped me develop friendships across grade levels, making me feel more connected to the students at Shasta,” Robinson said.

She went on to say how the Young Dreamer Network impacts the community: “Volunteering helps build empathy and confidence, which our club members are showing in their everyday lives,” she said. “I know that as individuals in a community become stronger in character, the community will too.”

Overall, the clubs at Summit Shasta have made a difference in students’ personal lives, and their communities. Robinson said, “They provide a safe space for people to share their interests and ultimately help unite people from different grades who would have otherwise not known each other.”
