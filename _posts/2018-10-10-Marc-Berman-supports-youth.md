State Assemblymember Marc Berman would like to better protect the youth in his community through improved mental health services.

“In this year’s budget, I got $1.7 million for the state to identify the best online youth mental health and suicide prevention training that is available and then buy enough subscriptions to make it available for every middle school and high school student in the state for free,” Rep. Berman said.

According to [kidsdata.org](https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/213/youthsuicide-rate/table#fmt=2311&loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&tf=93), “in 2013-2015, there were 7.9 suicides per 100,000 California youth ages 15-24.” Rep. Berman believes that support from community members can help teens dealing with mental health issues. “We need trainers for the prevention of suicide and depression,” he said.

He added that the goal is to help youth recover from trauma. “It’s important that we recover from that and we understand that is a part of growing up,” Rep. Berman said.  “We need embrace failure.”

The homeless population is also a large demographic who suffer from mental health issues.  “A lot of our homeless are going through mental health problems, so we need to get them into stable housing, but we can’t just then give them a key and walk away. We have to give them the wraparound services,” Rep. Berman said.

“More than one-quarter of the total homeless population nationwide live in California,” [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/california-today-states-homeless-population-drives-national-increase.html) states. This accounts for roughly 114,000 people.
