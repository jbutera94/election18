Finances are the core of a city’s government, and Sunnyvale City Council candidates believe they must consolidate the city’s finances before moving onto other ventures. Candidate discussion at an Oct. 4 press conference, held at Summit Denali, revolved around the sustainable financial situation of the city of Sunnyvale.

The press conference included the incumbent and challenger candidates for Sunnyvale City Council Seats 1 and 2, and it allowed students to interact with local politicians. The candidates discussed with students a multitude of city problems like traffic, education, environment, and, central to our analysis, finances.

When asked what the central path toward progress was for the City of Sunnyvale, Mayor Glenn Hendricks said improving the stability of the city’s finances would go a long way toward the city’s development and its ability to tackle all challenges with the best interests of the people in mind: “There are a lot of things we have to work on, but I think finances are at the core, in order to bring quality of life,” Mr. Hendricks said.

Later on in the press conference, when opposing views on finances were brought up, Mr. Hendricks reiterated the core issue of finances and how they are crucial for the city’s development. According to his thinking, where the city must start is “with the long term finances of the city. We have to be sustainable. We have to be able to pay for all the core services that people want to have.”

Challenger Josh Grossman also believes in the importance of finances, but he also focused on other aspects of the City of Sunnyvale: “It’s great to have a balanced budget, and that’s really critical, but if we sacrifice our quality of life … so I want to have both.” Despite his intent to improve the quality of life for residents, he agrees that the budget must be taken into account and kept stable.

Challenger Henry Alexander III discussed the openness of the budget and the city’s transparent use of finances, an issue he sees as prevalent. “Be it budgets, be it the amount people are being paid, be it the amount people are giving finance … for campaigns, these are things I think people care about.”

The remaining incumbent candidate, Gustav Larsson, discussed the importance of the city’s drive toward clean energy. Despite not touching on financial aspects of such a venture, he described the benefits it would entail — giving it an importance above many other projects the City of Sunnyvale was considering. “Actually, the City of Sunnyvale has already taken the initiative…on bringing clean energy.”
