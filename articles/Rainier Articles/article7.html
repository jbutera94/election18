        Many of the politicians in San Jose have made a difference for everyone in the past and are still making differences as we speak. These people have been through the hard process of campaigning, and many of them have needed to get closer to the voters and make themselves seem as if they were average people, trying to make a difference. To do this, many of them share their own personal life stories as to how they have come to be here, and many of them also talk about their past careers and qualifications. This article will shed light and touch on how some of these city politicians have gotten to where they are now, what their beliefs are, and how they aim to influence society some of their goals and accomplishments for society.

                <b>San Jose City Council: District 1</b><br> San Jose City Council member from District 1, Charles Jones, also known as “Chappie,” was elected for office in November 2014 with 60 percent of the vote. He spent his early years in the city of Sacramento, and, in 1990, moved with his family to San Jose. He was raised by his parents with the ideals that he should participate in helping out his city and community as much as he can. To this day, he still holds those values as he helps the people of his district in various ways to meet the needs of the community.

        Mr. Jones, whose term in office expires at the end of this year, went on to win re-election earlier this year in June. In 2014, the race for his current term, Mr. Jones ran against six others in the primary elections, and, this year, he ran unopposed, winning all 12,440 votes of the 12,440 who voted. He holds many other titles in the City of San Jose such as the following: Vice Chair of the Public Safety, Finance, and Strategic Support Committee (PSFSS); Liaison of the Board of Fair Campaign & Political Practices (formerly Ethics Commission); and many more. He still lives up to his own standards and helps out his community in many ways besides just carrying his main title. By the end of this year, he will continue to be in office and serve the people of San Jose’s District 1 for another term of four years.<br>

A second recount still resulted in a win for Mr. Diep. How he got his reputation: Mr. Diep brought the shield that was used in the filming of the film “Captain America” to his inauguration and wore it proudly, as he says that he wants to make politics and government fun. He takes this pride with him every day as he continues to serve the people of District 4.

        As we have seen, many of San Jose’s City Council Members have worked hard at their campaigns in the past, and many of them are still running for future terms. All politicians must have their set of standards that they have to run and adhere by them to please the people they serve to be able to run for a second position. We put our faiths, futures and hopes in their hands, and many of them put their life into helping us and what they stand for.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of earlier this summer, council members from Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 all ran for re-election while politicians from District 9 are campaigning for the empty seat. This fall on November 6, the San Jose City Council members will be elected for those districts at the same time as the Mayor of San Jose and the midterm elections. At the same time, California’s governor will also be elected as well as our State Representatives for the House. With so many elections going on, there could be a possible shift in power of which political party has control over society, even on a city-community level.
