    </h4>
    <p>
        San Jose Councilman Tam Nguyen’s base priority is community. Mr. Nguyen, a councilman from District 7 who is currently running for re-election on the November ballot, visited Summit Public School: Rainier on Sept. 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        He recalled one of two words he kept in mind before running for District 7: safety. “Safety in your home, safety in your school, safety when you’re in the park, safety when you work, and safety on the street - transportation, and personal safety” are all important priorities, he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen emphasized multiple times that communities are the base of his support. He mentioned that starting with the community and gaining their support  will create a strong base for one’s election campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
        Health is another subject he believes should be prioritized within our community. “I mean cleanliness; I mean clean neighborhoods, clean parks, clean roads and a healthy environment.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        To gain and maintain the support of the community, he continues to give back by visiting multiple neighborhoods to help with cleanup. He even went as far as to leave his phone number on the whiteboard, letting students know they can send him a text and he will show up at our neighborhoods and help pick up trash. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the council member, small steps like cleaning up trash in parks and neighborhoods and keeping those in the community safe build toward his overall more strenuous goal. Mr. Nguyen explained that as an attorney his slogan had always been “advocating for the disadvantaged families.” That is exactly what he continues to work toward by participating in community events and spending a generous amount of time working with the community.
