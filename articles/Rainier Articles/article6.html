        Councilman Nguyen is on a journey to positively impact his community

    </h4>
    <p>
        San Jose Councilman Tam Nguyen has been on a journey to become an important and impactful member of the community. Through his many years of volunteering and helping other people, Mr. Nguyen has developed a strong connection with the community and its people, which has helped him in reaching the position of a council member.
    </p>
    <p>
        From his early rough childhood in Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen came to the United States 43 years ago due to the dangerous warfare in his home country. He has worked his way up from being a dishwasher in Michigan, to getting a B.A, then later receiving an M.B.A  and becoming an attorney, to now being one of San Jose’s councilmen and representing District 7. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At a press conference that took place on Sept. 12, Mr. Nguyen explained to reporters at Summit Public School: Rainier the importance of wanting “to do good for the people in the community” and “advocating for [the] disadvantaged.” Mr. Nguyen’s relationship with the community has only become stronger since his election in 2014; he said “we are [the] best diverse community.”
    </p>
    <p>
        However, Mr. Nguyen did not plan to be a councilman in the first place; he said he had “heard bad things about politicians,” but the people of the community had said otherwise and so he said, “I’ll take on the challenge,” which led him to be elected as a San Jose councilman. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen said, ”If you don’t have the community’s support, forget it,” adding onto why community is so important to him. He stated previously that community means a lot to him because community is what has gotten him so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        When he came to the United States, he had no money, no clothes, no recognition, no nothing. Slowly he started working his way up the ladder and bettering his situation. Mr. Nguyen, coming from a tough situation while growing up, is able to empathize with the disadvantaged and the minorities within our community. He said that there’s “always a struggle between the rich and the poor” and that “minorities are in need of legal services.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen, if re-elected as councilman, said he plans to do better: ”two words, safety and health.” He went on to say that he plans to better the safety of our community by making sure that our neighborhoods, schools, and homes are secure. He also plans on bettering the health of our community by making sure that our surroundings and environment are clean.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is a dedicated man who plans on making change throughout San Jose - so devoted that he has even offered for people to call him if there is trash so he can go and help clean it up. By offering his services, he not only contributes to this community but he also gains the community’s support and trust in order for him to keep his current position as councilman and continue to make positive changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen has learned that when being a councilman you “don’t do something at the expense of others” and you “don’t take things too personal.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, Mr. Nguyen’s journey from escaping his country to now being one of San Jose’s city councilmen has been an eventful and transformative experience for him and the people of San Jose. He has devoted a lot of his time and work to bettering San Jose by being an ally to our community in District 7.
