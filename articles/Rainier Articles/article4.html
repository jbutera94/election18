    <p>
        City Councilman Tam Nguyen aims to improve community one step at a time using small and attainable goals. He said he didn’t have big names advocating for him or lots of money, but he had the support of the community by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen said it’s impossible to win a race “if you don’t have community support.” At a press conference at Summit Public School: Rainier on Sept. 12, he explained that before you can accomplish anything as a politician, “You got to be one of them; you got to be part of them first.”
    </p>
    <p>
        When he first began running for City Council, he made big plans. Later he realized he needed to set smaller and simpler goals to ensure that real progress would be made, rather than making big promises that couldn’t all be kept.Mr. Nguyen talked about how he planned to make small changes in the community that little by little would make a world of difference for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen said that on Saturdays he makes time to help clean around the neighborhood in the community to make things better for the people who live there. Although it is not a big project, it is something that slowly but surely improves the community.
    </p>
    <p>
        He later added that he would like to increase law enforcement by getting more police officers on the street to keep crime rates down and ensure the people’s safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen said that when he first started running his campaign he “heard bad things about politicians,” such as the Little Saigon fight in San Jose that occured because the community disliked how the person in office was deciding to handle certain situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Nov. 15, 2007, the <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/11/15/little-saigon-fans-call-san-jose-councilwoman-nguyen-pro-communist/">Mercury News reported</a> that council member Madison Nguyen was trying to stop the community from turning on her because of the Little Saigon conflict. People were upset because even though mostly everyone who lived there expressed that they wanted the neighborhood to be named Little Saigon, Ms. Nguyen ignored them and instead went ahead with her own name for the area - one that she felt would attract non-Vietnamese people as well.  Because of her refusal to name it Little Saigon, many people became infuriated with her choices, held many protest against her and called her a traitor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/11/15/little-saigon-fans-call-san-jose-councilwoman-nguyen-pro-communist/">Mercury News later explained</a> that the conflict got so heated that Ms. Nguyen faced “threats of a recall from Little Saigon supporters who say she is siding with her business associates instead of the people who voted her into office.” Because of these reasons the community went to Mr. Nguyen to hopefully drive the council into a better direction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “When her time was up in 2014, people in the community said, ‘Tam, we want you to be a city council member.’ And because people kept pushing the idea on him, he later agreed and decided that he did in fact want to run for City Council. Ever since, he’s been making sure to always listen to the community and to put the people first in all situations to become stronger and better together. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen has shown himself to be a good councilman; rather than making large plans that might be difficult to accomplish, he instead makes smaller, simpler, easier to reach goals that better the community. This, along with his general concern for the people’s well-being and his willingness to listen to the opinions and feedback of his supporters, has made him a well-liked and trusted council member.
