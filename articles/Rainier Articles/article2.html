    </h4>
    <p>
        San Jose City Council Member Tâm Nguyen tries to approach change and be open to new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I take on the challenge.” Mr. Nguyen said that he is willing to grow through new experiences and that he is determined to make San Jose safe and healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen wants the best for San Jose. He does this by helping the community and volunteering his own time to make the San Jose community a better place for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Sept. 12, Mr. Nguyen came to get interviewed by Summit Rainier’s Multimedia Political Journalism class. He spoke about how he was poor in college and how he had to leave Vietnam because his country fell into communism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen started out in the United States as a “broke college student” and came here with “nothing to my name.”
    </p>
    <p>
        With nothing, he made it into something. He told himself he could and he would. With the baby steps he took, he accomplished his dream and he keeps on dreaming today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen made it a point to prove how much his community is important to him and how with hard work and perseverance he was able to achieve the position he is in today. He believes in hard work and never takes a day off: “I always work hard every single day.”
    </p>
    <p>
        As a council member, Mr. Nguyen feels very firmly about productivity and bettering his town. Because of his passion, he makes himself available to clean up neighborhoods and his community every Saturday morning with the help of his volunteers whenever he can.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen makes sure that the people of his district know he’s available to help. Here’s a recent cleanup he organized in a San Jose community:

        Picking up trash in his neighborhood is only one of the challenges that he’s faces as he tries to improve life and safety for the people of his district. He has overcome many challenges, but he likes to do “one thing at a time.” He keeps things slow and steady so he can do more things that will benefit the community. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen isn’t afraid to take on new things, and he does it all with the help of his community. “I’m so lucky to be here. I’m grateful.”
