    <p>
        As an immigrant, San Jose Councilman Tam Nguyen feels he is responsible for supporting the immigrant community in his district. He told his story to reporters at Summit Public School: Rainier on Sept. 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        If he had not been allowed into this country as a young refugee, he asked, “Where would I be?” Mr. Nguyen is an immigrant himself; he said he came here a very broken and broke college student, as a refugee from Vietnam. He was rescued by the Korean Embassy on the boat he left Vietnam on; after he was rescued, he came to America with nothing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After arriving in America, he got his first job as a dishwasher 43 years ago and has never stopped working a day since. After taking a year to work and gain stability, he started attending college in Missouri. As a college student, he said he “didn’t know anything.” Then he began studying music because he could play the guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on, in 1980, electronics were on the rise. He became an engineer at Tandem Computing. They let him continue attending college, where he studied law. He said he studied law because they needed more Vietnamese-American lawyers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr. Nguyen said it was extremely challenging to go from music to law, but he was ready for it. He said he had already risked everything by leaving Vietnam. At first he started with one class, which he said was difficult but rewarding. He said at the time he thought, “If I don’t become [an] attorney, this will still be good for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        From 1992 until recently he was an attorney. In 2014 a seat was open on the San Jose City Council. Originally, he did not want to become a politician. “I didn’t like it,” he said. “I heard about how politicians operate.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He discussed how he won the election for City Council against his three other experienced opponents. First he had to identify real issues in the community. He said a way to do that was to volunteer so “they don’t feel threatened by you, by your weaknesses or even your strengths.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on in the press conference he was asked about the issue of the gun control legislation. He said that it is “absolutely incomprehensible” and that the “NRA, National Rifle Association, has a chokehold on Washington, DC.” He expressed that teachers are there so students can learn - that they are teachers, “not soldiers.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He also spoke about the issue of sanctuary laws and immigration. He said the police force will not be questioning who you are as a person or as an immigrant. His personal belief is that they should not act as an immigration law enforcement. Instead after interacting with the police force he thinks they should be making people feel safe, not making the public think of the police as a deportation threat. He told them, “Don’t use our police force.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        He said only America has an immigration problem, because coming to America is a dream. He said in his opinion “America is still magic” - that even with the recent immigration problems and debates, “You are the luckiest people in the whole wide world.”
