    <h4>
        By Jamil Abed, Mark Haiko, Ellen Hu and Angela Hwang
    </h4>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The candidates for Sunnyvale City Council agree sustainability is a vital part of the city’s future. Improving citywide traffic, they concur, is a large part of that goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Oct. 4, Sunnyvale City Council candidates Glenn Hendricks, Josh Grossman, Henry Alexander III and Gustav Larsson visited Summit Denali to participate in a student-led press conference hosted by journalists from Summit News.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Mr. Larsson, the Seat One incumbent, said Sunnyvale has already launched effective clean energy programs. “The question is,” he asked, “how can we put it to use better?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city council members </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/25/sunnyvale-municipal-electricity-to-go-100-percent-green-energy/"><span style="font-weight:400;">voted in favor</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> of joining the Silicon Valley Clean Energy Grant in December 2016. The program was </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/25/sunnyvale-municipal-electricity-to-go-100-percent-green-energy/"><span style="font-weight:400;">launched in early April 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in partnership with PG&amp;E. The grant provides Sunnyvale city residents with 100 percent renewable energy in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions in the Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">While discussing green energy, Mr. Larsson said, “I was really proud that Sunnyvale actually led the push in the Santa Clara County area to do that.” The hope of both himself and fellow incumbent Mr. Hendricks is that other Bay Area communities will take Sunnyvale’s lead and endeavor to create a cleaner environment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"><span style="font-weight:400;">EPA</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, cars and additional methods of transportation account for nearly 28.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The candidates discussed how these means of transportation affect both the heavy traffic and the carbon emissions produced in the city. For that reason, it is an issue that is at the focus of their campaigns.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Current Mayor Glenn Hendricks said that there are traffic demand management programs which work with businesses to mitigate the number of cars on the road. As a part of these programs, he said that buses take “30 to 40“ cars out of traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Another option is to encourage more people to travel using public transportation or methods that do not produce greenhouse emissions. “The other thing that I think is very interesting is modeling after cities like San Jose who have those rentable bicycles or motorized scooters,” Mr. Alexander expressed. “It’s a little more fun, and it also helps the environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"><span style="font-weight:400;">EPA</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, 11 percent of 2016 greenhouse gas emissions from homes and buildings “arise primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of certain products that </span><span style="font-weight:400;">contain greenhouse gases, and the handling of waste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The candidates agree that replacing electricity with natural gas in buildings is a large step in Sunnyvale’s path towards a greener future. “On newer construction,” Mr. Hendricks said, “we’re going to be seeing some changes happening at a policy level about that going forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, financial sustainability must also be taken into account when considering the implementation of these environmentally sustainable practices. “It’s great to have a balanced budget, and that’s really critical, but if we sacrifice our quality of life to achieve that balanced budget we’ve gotta really rethink our strategy,” Mr. Grossman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The candidates believe that incentivizing other forms of green energy will effectively integrate these systems into Sunnyvale. Mr. Alexander said, “I will look into how we can incentive not only apartment buildings but also businesses to use things like solar energy or solar panels within their buildings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Bay Area has followed Sunnyvale in taking a step towards a more sustainable future. “San Francisco is also looking into setting up a community choice energy activation to get their energy from cleaner sources,” Mr. Larsson said. “But we’ve already done that.”  </span></p>
