       Four candidates for Sunnyvale City Council are very concerned about the amount of traffic in the city. 

On Oct. 4, four City Council members came to visit Summit Denali to answer questions at a student-led press conference help by the journalist at Summit News. 

Mr. Grossman spoke about how the traffic has gotten really bad in the Bay Area. He said if he becomes elected he will try and help fix the major traffic problem. 

Mr. Grossman said, “I was taking my daughter to work on Oct. 4 and noticed the amount of traffic has increased considerably over the last year.” He and the other council members were concerned about the amount of traffic, and they said they think it is due to the number of big developments that are coming into the Bay Area. 

For example, they just finished building the new Apple campus on Wolfe Road, and there is now considerably more amount of traffic, Mr. Grossman said. We need to find a way to lessen the amount of traffic before it comes to a big problem, he explained. 

The city council members said they think the big companies like Apple and Google should provide buses to lessen the amount of traffic in the city of Sunnyvale, especially since those companies keep building new campuses and increasing the amount of traffic.

For example, if Apple and Google would get buses, then that would reduce traffic by having fewer cars on the road, Mr. Grossman said. If people would carpool, then it would reduce traffic. 

On his website, Mr. Grossman states, “I’m running to ensure we can work to ensure a good quality of life in Sunnyvale by mandating Better Traffic Management.”

Mr. Alexander also said he wants to manage traffic lights to make the flow of traffic better. 

On his website, Mr. Alexander states, “We must manage traffic congestion now because of serious impacts to safety and quality of life in our city.”

Mr. Larsson said he also wants traffic to be improved in Sunnyvale. To improve traffic, he believes that fewer people should drive their cars and that they could walk or bike or take public transit instead. 

On his website, Mr. Larsson states, “We implemented a state-of-the-art intelligent traffic signal system.” 

Mr. Hendricks added that he also wants to help improve the traffic in Sunnyvale to help the community be a better place.

On his website, Mr. Hendricks states that he wants to “implement a holistic view of traffic for the city of Sunnyvale and the state of California.”
