       California State Assemblymember Marc Berman values affordable housing, election security and protections for sexual assault survivors. When asked what issue is most important, he stated, “We have a lot of issues.” On Oct. 5, Rep. Marc Berman visited Summit Denali to answer questions about his position and what he wants to do in office. 

When talking about his most important issues, he leaned the most toward housing, saying, “Housing has impacted the health of the environment and education.”  

Rep. Marc Berman claimed housing is affecting education in the state; through the lack of housing, teachers have to live farther away, giving them less time to work after school with students and run clubs. On the subject of school funding, he responded, “School funding is so unstable because the majority of our money comes from the volatile income tax,” and added that we need to put this money in reserves.

Talking about California’s homelessness situation, Rep. Marc Berman stated that we need to give homeless people food after we give them housing so that they can permanently reside there, and that “we need to improve the mental health services to the homeless.” 

When asked about what role large companies have in the communities they reside in, he said, “They should play a big role,” and that “Apple is terrible when it comes to social corporate responsibilities.”

On the subject of global warming, Rep. Marc Berman stated that “the national government is not helping.” On the same topic, Rep. Marc Berman said, “Texas and coal states are dead wrong about having a good economy and being good to the environment … we are right; they are wrong.” 

Reaching the issue of immigration and national government policies, Rep. Marc Berman said, “I think that we are passing good ones in California, and they are passing bad ones in D.C”. He proceeded to say, “Both my parents are immigrants ... Our diversity makes our state so much stronger … we will keep passing laws to protect our immigrants.”

When he was asked what the most important bill he has passed was, he didn’t definitively say which; however, he did say, “I think the work I have done with elections and sexual assault survivors… I’ve done a lot of work with youth mental health.” 

According to Rep. Marc Berman, he got into politics because growing up in Palo Alto showed him his privileges compared to friends he played competitive soccer with, and one of his relatives being a senator allowed him the opportunity to familiarize himself with politics. He also said that his role models are “my parents, Congressman Mike Honda, and Senator Tom Daschle.”

When asked what his greatest strength is, he responded “listening and empathy.” Connecting back to his role model Tom Daschle, he also pointed out that you need empathy in any leader.
