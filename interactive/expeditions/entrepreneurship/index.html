            Entrepreneurship is an Expeditions course that teaches students how to start a business, negotiate and overall become successful with their own startups. The class consists of creating products and advertising these products to people who would be interested in buying them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Danica Lyming, the Entrepreneurship Expeditions teacher, said, “[Students] basically learn how to make your own product or service. You make it; you advertise it; you pitch it at a competition and potentially win money.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Shasta freshman Javier Gomez talked about the creative freedom Ms. Lyming gives them as they create their products. He said, “You can make anything; she lets you run wild with that idea.”
