            Summit Rainier opened its doors in 2011 to students of all backgrounds in the East Side San Jose area. Since then, they have maintained a 100 percent college acceptance rate for the past three years due in part to the personalized learning atmosphere Summit has created for its students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the grades 9 through 12 enrolled at Rainier, community remains at the core of the schoolâ€™s main focus. Through the small school environment, mentor groups and one-on-one class work, students feel strongly supported by their peers and administration to achieve their individual educational goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            To learn more about the impact Summit Rainier has had on the current seniors, the graduating Class of 2019, a campus visit was arranged to interview its students and their mentors about their opinion on how well Summit academically prepares students for college.
